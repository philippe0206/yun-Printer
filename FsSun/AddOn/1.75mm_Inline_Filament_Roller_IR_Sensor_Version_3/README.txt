# Summary

A Kickstarter campaign for this product is live:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/522476987/filament-roller
Make a donation and receive a finished Filament Roller. Thanks for your support~

This is a prototype IR sensor and alarm which detects the direction and speed of your 1.75mm filament spool. This sensor will sound an alarm when your spool stops due to:
    - filament-jamming,
    - nozzle-clogging,
    - extruder-grinding,
    - motor-stalling,
    - out-of-filament,
    - or end-of-print.
If your filament stops moving forward, this sensor will detect it and alert you.

This third version is a compact model designed to fit inline with your filament, close to your extruder. This design is for 1.75mm.

Required parts:
    - 608 ball bearings (2 ea)
    - M3 x 12mm screws (4 ea)
    - M3 x 18mm screws (2 ea)
    - M3 nuts (6 ea)
    - Filament Roller control board (1 ea)
    - Small rubber bands (1 ea)

## The Roller

After printing the roller, you should paint it so it can block IR light.

After the paint dries, then insert the bearing and slip on the rubber band.

## Assembly

1) Insert a bearing cap and screw the roller into the pylon using an M3x12mm screw.
2) Insert a bearing cap and screw the counter-bearing together using an M3x12mm screw.
3) Screw the pylon to the PCB and case using M3x12mm screws.
4) Screw the counter-bearing assembly to the pylon using M3x18mm screws.


## 12V Wall Adapters

For powering the board, you can use a 5-24V DC wall adapter. The DC jack should have a 5.5mm outer diameter and a 2.0 or 2.1mm inner diameter.

## Alternative Power

Alternatively, you can power the board through directly connecting it to your 3D printer's SMPS.

Do not simultaneously connect a wall adapter and SMPS power to the board at the same time. To do so is hazardous and can permanently damage your equipment.

## How to Use

To control the alarm delay, adjust the control knob on the PCB. In the example shown below, the delay is set to 21 seconds and the forward direction of the roller is set to counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise).
